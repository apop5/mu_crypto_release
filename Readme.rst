============================
Mu Crypto Release Repository
============================

This project behaves like a FW platform. It consists of scripts, pipelines, and submodules to perform
a binary release of EDK2 CryptoPkg drivers to power the BaseCryptOnProtocol/Ppi infrastructure.

These releases will be tagged and tracked in this  repo, but published to the Mu Nuget feed.

This repository is part of Project Mu.  Please see Project Mu for details https://microsoft.github.io/mu

Repo Scripts
============

Here is a brief description of the scripts and how they are used.

CommonBuildSettings.py
----------------------

This script is not to be used directly, but is a configuration module to be consumed by the other scripts
in this repo (or used directly as a Stuart settings module). If any submodules or scopes need to be changed,
this is the place to do it.

Note that any changes to names might require additional changes in other scripts that look for those names
when copying files around.

SingleFlavorBuild.py
--------------------

This script will run an EDK2 build of a single flavor and a single target of CryptBin. Example: ``TINY_SHA,DEBUG`` or
``STANDARD,RELEASE``. This is because a single EDK2 build run requires a single and flavor target and so each run
must be set up independently. This script is called multiple times by the ``MultiFlavorBuild.py`` script.

Should have good support for ``-h`` and print a useful help menu.

MultiFlavorBuild.py
-------------------

This script organizes a build 

Building on a Local Dev System

Releasing a Pipeline Build
==========================

TODO

First Steps (for a new integration)
-----------------------------------

TODO
Check gitmodules and make sure all other repos are passing CI
Branch
Update the pipeline default variables for new branch

Regular Release Steps
---------------------

Check to see whether the Basetools files need to be regenrated
WHEN COMPARING THE NEW AUTOGENERATED FILES, IF ANY NEW FUNCTIONS ARE ADDED (or if any existing family is updated to
add new functions) must look at Crypto.template.h and update the EDKII_CRYPTO_VERSION!!!!

Update to correct branches/commits of submodules
